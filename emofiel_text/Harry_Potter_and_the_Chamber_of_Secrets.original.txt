# # Harry Potter # # has returned to the # # Dursley family # Dursleys # # for the summer holiday in mid - # # 1992 # # , and things are very bad for him .
Over the summer , the Dursleys have become so fearful of Harry 's new-found # # magic # # al abilities that they have locked away all of Harry 's magical supplies -LRB- e.g. # # Harry Potter 's wand # his wand # # , # # Harry Potter 's Nimbus 2000 broomstick # his broomstick # # , spellbooks , etc. -RRB- immediately after his arrival home .
They have also banned Harry from saying words such as `` magic '' in the # # 4 Privet Drive # house # # , as evident in # # Vernon Dursley # Uncle Vernon # # 's outburst at breakfast .
This has become a problem for Harry himself , who begins to worry about what his teachers at # # Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry # # will think if he heads back to them without back homework done , and whether or not he 'll be banned from the # # Gryffindor Quidditch team # Gryfindor House Quidditch team # # since he has not been able to practise .
The only thing the Dursleys let him keep in his room , however , is his pet snowy owl # # Hedwig # # , but have put a padded lock on her cage to keep her inside day and night to avoid suspicion from the neighbours .
This does not go well for the bird , because every time she has become bored , her screech has rung throughout the house , causing an irritated Vernon to warn Harry that if he can not control her , she will have to go .

On # # 31 July # # -LRB- Harry 's twelfth birthday -RRB- , Harry has never felt so lonely , for he misses Hogwarts and his best friends there , # # Ronald Weasley # Ron Weasley # # and # # Hermione Granger # # .
Neither of them have written to him all summer , not even to send birthday wishes .
The Dursleys seem to have also forgotten his birthday , because they are too busy preparing for a dinner party meant for one of Uncle Vernon 's clients , # # Mason # Mr Mason # # , from whom Vernon is hoping to get a huge order .
The only unchangeable thing on the Dursley 's schedule , however , is that Harry has to stay in his room for the night , making no noise and `` pretending he does n't exist '' .
While Uncle Vernon and # # Dudley Dursley # Dudley # # are preparing to drive into town to buy dinner jackets , Harry himself goes out into the garden in order to stay out of his # # Petunia Dursley # Aunt Petunia # # 's way as she is cleaning , singing happy birthday to himself .
He stares into the hedge , and sits bolt upright when he sees # # Dobby # a pair of enormous green eyes # # staring back at him among the leaves .
When Dudley comes waddling over and wishes his cousin a happy birthday , mocking him with the lack of celebrations .
Harry gets annoyed and scares him away by pretending to think of a # # spell # # meant to bur the bush bare out loud , but Petunia comes out when Dudley calls for her and beats her nephew with a soapy frying pan .
She then gives Harry some chores to do while Vernon and Dudley are gone , and once he is finished , it 's almost a half-hour before the Masons are due to arrive .
Harry goes up to his room without making a sound during the party as promised , but when he gets there , someone else is on his bed .

The thing on his bed , a # # House-elf # house elf # # named # # Dobby # # , tells Harry that he must not go back to # # Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry # Hogwarts # # , as it will be dangerous because terrible things are going to happen there .
The elf , however , ca n't tell him what things , and continues to be vague because every time he gets close to letting something slip he starts hurting himself .
In the process , he makes a lot of noise , which is noticed by the group downstairs .
When he hears Uncle Vernon coming upstairs -LRB- claiming that Dudley must have left the TV upstairs on -RRB- , Harry hides the elf in his closet right before Vernon comes in and scolds his nephew for making such a racket which has messed up the punchline of his '' # # Japanese golfer joke # # '' .
He lets Dobby out as soon as his uncle leaves , and insists that he has to go back to Hogwarts since that 's where he has friends despite them not writing to him .
But to his surprise , Dobby then reveals that he has stopped letters being sent to Harry , and offers them to him if Harry will stay away from Hogwarts .
Harry refuses and , making a frustrated Dobby run downstairs and use a # # Hover Charm # # to smash the dinner party 's pudding .

Harry is blamed for the incident once Dobby # # Apparition # Disapparates # # , and Uncle Vernon shoos the shocked Masons into the dining room while Harry cleans up , promising to deprive the boy of an inch of his life .
The evening is almost saved until an owl from the # # British Ministry of Magic # Ministry of Magic # # is promptly received -LRB- scaring away # # Mason 's wife # Mrs Mason # # , who is mortally afraid of birds -RRB- with a warning saying that Harry has violated the # # Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery # # , though he is not actually punished -LRB- possibly because it is only his first offence -RRB- .
After realising that Harry is n't allowed to do magic outside of Hogwarts grounds , Uncle Vernon locks Harry in his # # The Smallest Bedroom # room # # .
Vernon reasons that if Harry uses magic to get himself out , he will be expelled anyway .

The Dursleys ' punishment lasts for three days , until # # Ronald Weasley # Ron # # , # # Fred Weasley # Fred # # , and # # George Weasley # # , worried about not hearing from Harry all summer , borrow their father 's # # flying Ford Anglia # # and come to the rescue .
They are able to break the metal bars off Harry 's window and help him pick the lock to his door so that he can get his Nimbus 2000 and trunk .
The Dursleys discover his escape attempt , but by the time they can intervene , Fred , George , Ron and Harry have got everything of Harry 's and have flown away .
On the flight to the Burrow , Harry explains Dobby 's warning .
They all agree that it 's very fishy and speculate that Dobby most likely belongs to the Malfoys who sent Dobby to Harry as a joke since the Malfoys are an old wizarding family of great wealth .
Fred and George tell Harry that Lucius Malfoy used to work for Voldemort but claimed that the Dark Lord bewitched him after Voldemort lost his powers .
Harry is taken to # # the Burrow # # , the Weasleys ' home , and he finds the house truly amazing .
Since Ron , Fred and George took the car without permission , they are yelled at by # # Molly Weasley # # , who was waiting in the kitchen .
After their scolding , she makes them breakfast and has the three Weasley boys -LRB- and Harry who volunteered -RRB- # # Gnome # de-gnome # # the garden refusing to use a technique from '' # # Gilderoy Lockhart 's Guide to Household Pests # # '' , and do it their own way .
# # Arthur Weasley # # soon comes home and is honoured to meet Harry after they are introduced to each other .
Molly , his wife , yells at him for enchanting the car .
# # Ginevra Weasley # Ginny Weasley # # , who was enrolling at Hogwarts that year , is very obviously enamoured with Harry and spends most of the chapter hiding from him .

Harry stays at the Burrow until his departure for Hogwarts .
The Weasleys make it clear that they all like Harry .
For example , Arthur insists that Harry sit next to him during meals where Molly , who constantly deplores the state of his hand me down clothes and how thin he is , insists that he eat extra food .
During that period , he and the Weasleys travel to # # Diagon Alley # # with # # Floo Powder # # in order to get their school supplies .
Harry has difficulty with the smoke around him and says `` Diagon Alley '' unclearly , and thus he accidentally lands in a shop in the ill-reputed # # Knockturn Alley # # instead .
The shop is # # Borgin and Burkes # # , specialising in objects related to # # Dark Arts # Dark magic # # .
There he sees # # Lucius Malfoy # # , father of # # Draco Malfoy # # , Harry 's arch rival from school , selling items imbued with Dark magic to a dark arts salesman , # # Borgin # Mr Borgin # # .
Lucius Malfoy explains that the Ministry has been conducting raids on wizard houses in order to uncover illegal artefacts , so he is selling his more problematic possessions .
He also expresses his disdain for a rumoured # # Muggle Protection Act # # , which he -LRB- rightly -RRB- assumes Arthur Weasley is behind .

Harry leaves the shop to be found by # # Rubeus Hagrid # Hagrid # # and taken back to # # Diagon Alley # # to reunite with the Weasleys and # # Hermione Granger # # , who is also there with # # Hermione Granger 's parents # her parents # # .
In # # Flourish and Blotts # # , he and the Weasleys meet the famous wizard/author # # Gilderoy Lockhart # # , who announces that he will be taking over as Hogwarts ' new # # Defence Against the Dark Arts # # teacher .
He then forces Harry to have his picture taken with him for the main page of the '' # # Daily Prophet # # '' .
They also meet Draco and Lucius Malfoy there .
The elder Malfoy continuously taunts and insults Arthur and his family and eventually Arthur lunges at him .
During the fight , Malfoy grabs one of the Weasleys ' second-hand books and after Hagrid breaks it up subsequently throws it back at Ginny in contempt .

It is time to return to Hogwarts , Harry and the Weasleys arrives at # # King 's Cross Station # # on the Ford Anglia , after several delays -LRB- Fred and George forgetting their broomsticks , and Ginny forgetting her diary . -RRB-
On the way to the # # Hogwarts Express # # , when Harry and Ron try to go through the barrier to # # Platform Nine and Three-Quarters # # after everyone else went through , the barrier is mysteriously sealed against them .
Having missed the train , Harry and Ron thus decide to fly Mr Weasley 's flying # # Flying Ford Anglia # Ford Anglia # # to Hogwarts .
They end up getting spotted by many # # Muggle # # s and crash into the # # Whomping Willow # # , the impact breaking # # Ron 's wand # # .
The giant tree starts pounding the car .
The battered car manages to escape , ejecting Harry , Ron , and their luggage , before quickly driving off into the # # Forbidden Forest # # .

After they make it to the castle , Professor # # Severus Snape # Snape # # catches the boys and attempts to have them expelled for being sighted and breaking wizard law to get to the castle .
# # Albus Dumbledore # # however , says he will send a letter to Harry and Ron 's families .
Still , Professor # # Minerva McGonagall # McGonagall # # gives a warning and separate detentions to both boys .
She also tells them that # # Ginevra Weasley # Ginny # # had been sorted into # # Gryffindor # # , providing them with # # Endless Sandwiches # # and disallowing them from attending the # # Start-of-Term Feast # # .

The next day , Ron receives a # # Molly Weasley 's Howler to Ronald Weasley # Howler # # from his # # Molly Weasley # mother # # during breakfast in the Great Hall .
Then , Minerva McGonagall hands out timetables and the first class is # # Herbology # # with the # # Hufflepuff # # s .
In the class , Professor Sprout teaches how to transplant # # Mandrake # # seedlings , which have restorative properties when mature .
The next class is # # Transfiguration # # , where Ron has problems with his broken wand , even when he repaired it with some Spellotape .
Later , the # # trio # # have their first lesson with # # Gilderoy Lockhart # # , appointed as the new # # Defence Against the Dark Arts # # teacher .
His way of teaching is a complete disaster .
Much to Harry 's chagrin , he receives constant attention from Lockhart and # # Colin Creevey # # , a first year student .
Both constantly interact with him on the base of his fame -LRB- Colin treats Harry as a celebrity and Lockhart hopes to actually bring him to that state -RRB- .

The # # Gryffindor Quidditch team # # has a very early practise on Saturday morning , where they are treated to an hour-long introduction to a new training programme # # Oliver Wood # # spent the summer working on .
Soon after the actual practise starts , the # # Slytherin Quidditch team # # , with new # # Nimbus 2001 # # broomsticks , arrives , and an argument over field time ensues .
During the confrontation , Malfoy is revealed to be the new Slytherin seeker , and the one responsible for getting the Slytherin team new brooms .
Hermione says that nobody on their team had to buy his way in , they made it on pure talent to which Malfoy calls # # Hermione Granger # Hermione # # a # # Mudblood # # , for which the Gryffindor team react angrily and Ron tries to curse him .
However , his damaged wand causes the curse to backfire and he is rushed to # # Rubeus Hagrid 's cabin # Hagrid 's cabin # # when he starts vomiting slugs .
Ron and Hagrid both explain to Harry that Mudblood is a very insulting name for Muggle-Borns like Hermione .
They also explain that there are some wizards like the Malfoys who think they 're better than everyone else because they 're Purebloods .
After they return to the castle , Professor McGonagall assigns Harry and Ron their detentions .
Harry is made to help Lockhart answer his fan mail , while Ron polishes the school 's prizes and trophies .
During his detention , Harry hears a disembodied sinister voice which Lockhart is unable to hear .

In return for distracting # # Argus Filch # # just when he 's about to give Harry severe punishment , Harry promises he will come to # # Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington # Nearly Headless Nick # # 's # # Deathday Party # # on # # Hallowe'en # # .
He brings Ron and Hermione along as well .
While there , they meet Moaning Myrtle .
The three of them quickly get sickened by the ghostly party and return to the # # Great Hall # # .

Before they get to the # # Hallowe'en feast # # , Harry hears the voice -LRB- which Ron and Hermione also can not hear -RRB- and follows it to the second floor , where he finds the bathroom flooded and # # Mrs Norris # # , Filch 's cat , hanging from a torch bracket , petrified and coupled with a message on the wall , reading '' '' THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS HAS BEEN OPENED .
ENEMIES OF THE HEIR , BEWARE '' '' .
Then , students leaving the Hallowe'en Feast surround them .
And Malfoy yells : `` Enemies of the Heir , beware !
You 'll be next , Mudbloods ! ''

# # Argus Filch # Filch # # and # # Severus Snape # Snape # # try to get Harry in trouble for what happened , but # # Albus Dumbledore # Dumbledore # # says that it is

powerful # # Dark Arts # dark magic # # that no second year student could perform .
They decide that # # Professor # # Sprout 's # # mandrake # # s will be used , once they are mature enough , to create a draught capable of reviving # # Mrs Norris # # .
# # Hermione Granger # Hermione # # wants to research the Chamber , so she persuades # # Professor # # # # Cuthbert Binns # Binns # # -LRB- the # # History of Magic # # teacher -RRB- into telling the class about it .
He explains that one of the founders of Hogwarts , # # Salazar Slytherin # # , got into an argument with the others about whether # # Muggle-born # # s should be admitted .
When the rift grew too large , he left the school .
According to legend , he built a going-away present to the school in the form of a secret chamber that could only be opened by his true heir .
This '' # # Chamber of Secrets # # '' contains a monster that only the Heir of Slytherin can control and that , once released , would purge the school of all Muggle-borns .
Binns unsuccessfully tries to assure the class that the Chamber does not actually exist and that the school has been searched many times in vain .

Harry , Ron and Hermione decide that the heir is probably # # Draco Malfoy # # since everyone in his family have been sorted into Slytherin House , he 's a Pureblood supremacist , and because his father worked for Voldemort .
To try to confirm it , Hermione proposes to use # # Polyjuice Potion # # , which can change a person into somebody else for an hour .
After getting Lockhart 's signature to check out the book # # Moste Potente Potions # # from the # # Restricted Section # # that has the recipe , Hermione warns them that the potion will take a month to brew , supposing they gather all the necessary ingredients -LRB- two of which can only be found in Snape 's private inventory -RRB- .
Since no one comes into Moaning Myrtle 's bathroom , the three of them decide it is the best place to brew the potion unnoticed .
Hermione begins working with the ingredients they have .

During the month that it takes the Polyjuice Potion to brew , a # # Quidditch # # match between # # Gryffindor # # and # # Slytherin # # takes place .
During the match , one of the # # Dobby 's Bludger # Bludgers # # stakes after Harry and focuses completely on him .
Since # # Bludger # # s are supposed to attack each and every player , the crowd immediately realises that this Bludger has been tampered with .
Harry still manages to catch the # # Golden Snitch # # and allow for # # Gryffindor # # to win thanks to the Slytherin Seeker Draco Malfoy wasting his time insulting Harry and not paying attention to his surroundings where the Snitch was hovering slightly above his left ear .
However , prior to catching the Snitch , the Bludger broke Harry 's arm , and Lockhart , attempting to fix it , gets rid of all the bones in his arm instead .
# # Poppy Pomfrey # Madam Pomfrey # # gives Harry # # Skele-Gro # # potion to counter this and Harry is forced to stay in the # # Hospital Wing # # overnight .

During that night , # # Dobby # # visits Harry and reveals that it was he who made the # # Dobby 's Bludger # Bludger # # chase after Harry , and was also responsible for the barrier of Platform Nine and Three-Quarters not letting him in for in hopes of Harry leaving or never arriving at Hogwarts .
He also reveals that the # # Chamber of Secrets # # has been opened before and immediately punishes himself , as he is not supposed to reveal anything .
After # # Dobby # # disappears , # # Albus Dumbledore # Dumbledore # # , # # Minerva McGonagall # McGonagall # # , and # # Poppy Pomfrey # Madam Pomfrey # # enter with # # Colin Creevey # # , who has also been petrified .
He was found with a camera containing film that has been burnt to the melting point .
Dumbledore just observes the camera saying , `` The Chamber of Secrets has indeed been opened again . ''

After Harry heads to Moaning Myrtle 's bathroom the next morning and explains the details he learned from Dobby , Hermione comes up with a plan of Harry and Ron providing a distraction in Potions so she can steal the remaining ingredients for the Polyjuice Potion from Snape 's private stores .
Shortly afterwards , when McGongall comes around with the sign-up list for the students who will remain in the school during # # Christmas # # , learning that # # Draco Malfoy # Malfoy # # , # # Vincent Crabbe # Crabbe # # , and # # Gregory Goyle # Goyle # # have signed up , Harry , Ron , and Hermione do this as well , since this gives them the perfect opportunity to use their Polyjuice Potion .
With Harry providing a distraction during Potions class by throwing a # # Filibuster # # firework into Goyle 's cauldron , it creates the necessary disturbance allowing Hermione to succeed without trouble , though Snape still suspects Harry 's involvement with this incident after finding the firework .
Harry later signs up for a # # Duelling Club # # which , to Harry 's great displeasure , is taught by his two least favourite teachers , Lockhart and Snape .
During a practise battle in the first meeting , # # Draco Malfoy # # conjures a snake to attack Harry .
Lockhart tries to banish it , but all he manages is to set it loose on the students .
Harry sees that the snake is advancing on a # # Hufflepuff # # student named # # Justin Finch-Fletchley # # and instinctively tells it to stop , which-to Harry 's great surprise-it does .
He expects Justin to be grateful Justin and the others are less than ecstatic about it .
All they saw was Harry speaking # # Parseltongue # # , the language of snakes , and since they can not understand it , it seemed to them that he was egging the snake on .
Harry learns that # # Parseltongue # # is a very rare gift that is closely associated with # # Salazar Slytherin # # .
Due to this , Harry becomes the number one suspect among students for being the heir of # # Slytherin # # .
Hermione even tells him that since # # Salazar Slytherin # # lived so long ago , he might actually be a descendant .
When a Herbology lesson is cancelled , Harry has a talk with Hagrid , who reveals that the school 's roosters are being mysteriously killed .
Seconds after leaving Hagrid , Harry runs into a petrified # # Justin Finch-Fletchley # # and a black , also petrified , Nearly-Headless Nick .
# # Peeves # # alerts the whole school , and a # # Hufflepuff # # student called # # Ernest Macmillan # Ernie Macmillan # # claims that Harry has been caught red-handed .

For the first time , Harry is taken to Dumbledore 's office , and there he witnesses # # Fawkes # # -- Dumbledore 's # # phoenix # # -- bursting into ashes and being reborn .
Dumbledore says that he does not believe Harry to be behind the attacks , a belief reinforced by Hagrid backing Harry 's alibi , but a large portion of the school is now sure that Harry is # # Slytherin # # 's heir .
When Christmas arrives -LRB- Harry 's gifts : a toothpick , fudge in a tin , a copy of '' # # Flying with the Cannons # # '' , a new # # quill # # , a jumper and plum cake -RRB- , with the Polyjuice Potion ready and Hermione having acquired some spare Slytherin robes to use -LRB- since they ca n't use their regular clothes while transformed -RRB- , they give to # # Vincent Crabbe # Crabbe # # and # # Gregory Goyle # Goyle # # two chocolate cakes containing `` sleeping pills '' that made both Crabbe and Goyle fall asleep once eating the cakes .
Harry and Ron take their hairs -LRB- and shoes due to Crabbe and Goyle having larger feet -RRB- and assume their form .
# # Hermione Granger # Hermione # # tries to use a hair she thought belongs to # # Millicent Bulstrode # # , but it is actually her # # cat hair # cat 's hair # # and Hermione is transformed into a cat/human hybrid .
Hermione is forced to spend a few weeks in the # # Hospital Wing # # .
As Crabbe and Goyle , once Draco leads them to the Slytherin common room , Harry and Ron interrogate an unsuspecting Malfoy and discover that even though he wishes he were , Draco is not the Heir of # # Slytherin # # .
They also hear that Lucius Malfoy mentioned that the last time the chamber was opened , fifty years ago , a # # Muggle-born # # student died and whoever was responsible was expelled .
Malfoy also mentions his father 's secret stash of illegal artefacts .

Weeks later , Ron and Harry overhear # # Argus Filch # # complaining about his workload and leaving .
They arrive at # # Myrtle Warren # Moaning Myrtle # # 's bathroom to find it flooded .
Myrtle , a sulking # # ghost # # , explains that she had flooded it because somebody flushed a # # Tom Riddle 's Diary # diary # # down the toilet and onto her .
Harry picks it up ; he discovers that it once belonged to somebody called T.M. Riddle , but the diary is completely blank .
# # Ronald Weasley # Ron # # remembers from his detention that Riddle had won an award for special service to the school fifty years before , as he had another slug attack on the trophy .
Hermione deduces that since this coincides with the last time the Chamber was opened , # # Tom Riddle # # might have received his prize for catching whoever was responsible for the attacks back then .
Even though all attempts to extract information from the diary fail , Harry feels a strange compulsion to keep it .
On # # Valentine 's Day # # , Ron and Harry are dismayed to find out Lockhart has spread dwarves dressed as cupids throughout the school to receive and deliver Valentines as a morale booster due to believing that he made the attacks stop .
One cupid-dwarf manages to deliver one -LRB- a singing valentine -RRB- to Harry .
While struggling to avoid him , the embarrassed Harry trips and falls , having ink spilled all over the contents of his bag .
Ginny notices the diary and assumes a horrified expression .
Draco Malfoy also tries to steal the diary as Harry is picking up his stuff , but an angered Harry stuns him , ignoring the fact that Percy Weasley was also there trying to handle the situation , which results in Percy reprimanding Harry .
Later , Harry realises that even though ink is spilled all over the diary , it is not stained at all .
He tries writing to the diary and , to his surprise , Riddle writes back .
He explains that he was the one who caught the person who opened the # # Chamber of Secrets # # the last time , and he can show Harry what happened .
Harry agrees and gets sucked into a `` recording '' of Riddle 's memory .
Transported back to 1943 , he witnesses the school 's previous headmaster , # # Armando Dippet # # , informing Riddle that the school will be closed , since now a Muggle-born girl has died .
Riddle is apprehensive of this , since it would mean getting sent back to # # Wool 's Orphanage # the Muggle orphanage he grew up in # # and grown to hate .
Dippet guesses that Riddle is Muggle-born as well , but Riddle corrects him by revealing that he 's actually # # half-blood # # , having been left at the orphanage after # # Merope Riddle # his witch mother # # died , but not before requesting her son 's first name to be Tom , after # # Tom Riddle Senior # his Muggle father # # , and his middle name to be Marvolo , after his # # Marvolo Gaunt # wizard grandfather # # .
When dismissed by Dippet and a 50-years-younger Dumbledore , Harry follows Riddle down into the dungeons , where the latter young wizard catches a 50-years-younger Hagrid fiddling with a young # # Acromantula # # in a cupboard .
Accusing the giant of harbouring the monster behind the death of the Muggle-born girl in question , Riddle reports Hagrid to Dippet despite Hagrid protest that that his Acromantula , who he has seemingly named # # Aragog # # , has never killed anyone .
Having seen this , Harry now believes Hagrid was the one who opened the Chamber fifty years before and he is responsible this time .

Harry , Ron and Hermione decide not to ask Hagrid about it , hoping that the attacks have stopped-and indeed , almost four months after the attack on # # Justin Finch-Fletchley # Justin # # and # # Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington # Nearly-Headless Nick # # , the disembodied voice keeps quiet and the attacks seem to have ceased .
However , odd things keep happening : Harry returns to his dormitory one day to find it a mess .
Ron deduces that somebody has been looking for something , and Harry eventually notices that # # Tom Riddle 's Diary # # is gone .
This greatly befuddles them , knowing that only a # # Gryffindor # # student or a staff member could know the password to enter the # # Gryffindor Tower # dormitory # # .
The next day , the scheduled # # Quidditch # # match between # # Gryffindor # # and # # Hufflepuff # # is cancelled due to yet another attack and # # Harry Potter # Harry # # hears the voice again .
This time # # Minerva McGonagall # # calls for Harry and Ron personally , and leads them to the # # Hospital Wing # # , where they see Hermione petrified .
She was found near the # # Hogwarts Library # library # # with a # # Ravenclaw # # # # prefect # # , holding a small , circular mirror .
This proves that Harry is not the Heir of Slytherin , since he would never attack one of his friends .
Harry and Ron decide they now must talk to Hagrid .
With the now constant supervision on students , this is not easy , but they manage to do it by using Harry 's # # Cloak of Invisibility # Invisibility cloak # # .
When they reach # # Rubeus Hagrid 's cabin # # Harry and Ron manage to hide just before # # Cornelius Fudge # # , who is the Minister for Magic , and Dumbledore arrive at the scene .
Fudge announces that Hagrid , who to the best of his knowledge opened the # # Chamber of Secrets # # the last time , will be sent to # # Azkaban # # prison as a precaution .
They are shortly joined by # # Lucius Malfoy # # , who declares that he and the other governors of Hogwarts have unanimously voted to suspend Dumbledore , despite the obvious logic that this would only worsen the situation .
Both Hagrid and Dumbledore give last words to Harry and Ron : Hagrid says that if anybody wants the truth they should `` follow the spiders '' and Dumbledore says that he will only truly have left the school when none there remain loyal to him .
He also stresses that if anybody at Hogwarts needs help , it will always be available to those who ask for it .

Days later , Professor McGonagall informs the students that the Mandrake Drought will soon be ready .
Later that same day , Harry and Ron manage to trick # # Gilderoy Lockhart # Lockhart # # - who is leading them to their next class - into letting them go by stroking his ego .
Just as they pat themselves on the back , they get caught by # # Professor # # McGonagall , and Harry has to make up an excuse - they were going to see # # Hermione Granger # Hermione # # in the # # Hospital Wing # # , where visitors were now barred .
They now have to go along to make their story appear convincing , but rather than simply hanging around Hermione 's petrified form , this time Harry notices a piece of paper tightly clutched in her hand .
This piece of paper reveals what Hermione had found out before she was attacked .
She had discovered , based on strong circumstantial evidence , that the monster in the # # Chamber of Secrets # # is a # # Salazar Slytherin 's Basilisk # Basilisk # # , one of the giant `` Kings of all Serpents '' , thus explaining the mysterious voice that only Harry could hear , as he is able to speak # # Parseltongue # # .
The Basilisk kills people by looking it in the eye , but no one died because nobody had directly looked at its deadly gaze : # # Colin Creevey # # saw it through his camera , # # Justin Finch-Fletchley # # saw it through # # Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington # Nearly-Headless Nick # # -LRB- who was already dead and since he could n't die `` again '' , he was only petrified -RRB- , # # Mrs Norris # # saw a reflection of it in the waters of the flooded bathroom , and both Hermione and # # Penelope Clearwater # # used a mirror to look around corners after Hermione has figured things out .
Harry finds out in the paper that spiders flee from it and how a rooster 's crow is potentially fatal to the Basilisk -LRB- which explains Hagrid 's roosters having been killed during the year -RRB- .
On the note is also scribbled a single word , `` pipes '' , which means that the serpent moves around through the plumbing -LRB- which helps them realise that the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is in # # Myrtle Warren # Moaning Myrtle # # 's bathroom -RRB- .
Having solved the mystery , Harry and Ron decide to go to the staff room and report to the teachers .
When they get there , they overhear the teachers talking about another attack having occurred .
Harry and Ron decide to hide to hear more details , and learn that Ginny has been kidnapped by the Basilisk itself and the heir of # # Slytherin # # has left another message under the previous one : '' '' HER SKELETON WILL LIE IN THE CHAMBER FOREVER '' . ''
Harry and Ron also hear that Hogwarts will be closed tomorrow .
The teachers then force Lockhart to deal with the monster , as he has been claiming he could handle whatever is responsible for the attacks .
Looking very crestfallen , he leaves for his room .
Harry and Ron decide that if Lockhart is going to deal with the monster they might as well tell him what they know .
They go to his room , only to find him frantically planning to run away .
When questioned on why such a talented # # Wizardkind # wizard # # as himself is leaving , Lockhart admits that he is a fraud who put # # Memory Charm # # s on the people who really did the things that he claimed to have done in his books .
He then attempts to put a Memory Charm on the two boys as well , but they manage to disarm him and , under # # wand # # threats , take him to Moaning Myrtle 's bathroom .

Moaning Myrtle explains her death , saying the last thing she saw was a pair of enormous eyes by one of the sinks , the tap of which has never worked .
Harry finds a snake carved on the tap and then opens the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets by speaking Parseltongue to it .
Harry , Ron and Lockhart slide down a large pipe and find themselves in maze-like tunnels far under the school .
Down there , they encounter a snake skin left by the Basilisk .
Just then , Lockhart feigns fainting and he steals Ron 's wand .
Victoriously proclaiming that he will erase Harry and Ron 's memories and tell everybody they lost their sanity at the sight of Ginny 's mangled body , Lockhart casts the Memory Charm .
# # Ronald Weasley 's first wand # Ron 's broken wand # # causes the charm to backfire , erasing Lockhart 's memory and causing a portion of the ceiling to cave in .
This traps Harry in the direction of the chamber and Ron in the direction of the castle .
Ron has no choice but to stay behind and clear a path through the rocks while Harry continues in search of Ginny .
Harry then encounters a wall with stone snakes on it , opens it by speaking Parseltongue and enters the Chamber itself .

The diary ends up with Ginny .
Riddle had written back sympathetically and Ginny grew to confess her fears , hopes and feelings to him .
She essentially poured some of her soul into him , which was exactly what he wanted .
He gradually grew more powerful and eventually managed to pour some of his soul back into her , possessing her and using her body to open the Chamber of Secrets , releasing the # # Salazar Slytherin 's Basilisk # Basilisk # # that launched the new series of attacks and to write the threatening messages on the walls .
However , Ginny became suspicious of the diary and tried to dispose of it by flushing it down the toilet in # # Myrtle Warren # Moaning Myrtle # # 's bathroom .
This is when Harry found it .
When Ginny saw Harry with the diary on # # Valentine 's Day # # , she panicked and worried that Riddle had told Harry about her role in the attacks , so she stole it back from his dormitory .
It began taking control of her again , but this time with the intention of killing Harry , so he had Ginny write her own farewell on the wall and come down to wait , luring Harry to the rescue and , consequently , his doom .
Riddle is angered that Harry managed to defeat the # # Dark Wizard # # # # Tom Riddle # Lord Voldemort # # as a mere baby .
When Harry asks Riddle why he cares about it , Riddle reveals that `` Voldemort is his past , present and future . ''
He then writes the air with Harry 's wand his full name , '' TOM MARVOLO RIDDLE '' , then waves the wand and the letters rearrange themselves into , '' I AM LORD VOLDEMORT . ''

Harry then realises that Lord Voldemort was only a pseudonym and that his real/birth name was Tom Marvolo Riddle .
Riddle explains that he could n't bare to use the name of # # Tom Riddle Senior # a Muggle father # # who abandoned him before his wizard son could be born , right when he found out that # # Merope Riddle # his wife # # was a # # Wizardkind # witch # # descended from # # Salazar Slytherin # # .
So he scrambled that name to create a new one , which he knew people would fear when he became the `` greatest sorcerer in the world '' .
Harry retorts that he must be mistaken , because the greatest sorcerer in the world , as everybody knows , is # # Albus Dumbledore # # .
Even when Voldemort was at the peak of his power he was afraid of Dumbledore , and now he is barely alive .
Riddle replies that Dumbledore has been driven out the castle by the mere memory of him .
Harry yells that Dumbledore is not as gone as Riddle seems to believe .
In this display of loyalty he summons # # Fawkes # # the # # phoenix # # to him , who also brings with it the # # Sorting Hat # # , both assets that Riddle deems extremely useless .

Riddle then summons the Basilisk and commands it to kill Harry .
However , Fawkes is n't as defenceless as one might initially think , and pecks out the Basilisk 's eyes , thus preventing its gaze from killing .
The basilisk can still hear and smell Harry , however , and remains very dangerous , so Harry , in desperation , puts on the Sorting Hat , wishing against hope for help .
Instead of an answer , Harry Potter has # # Godric Gryffindor 's Sword # a heavy sword with a hilt embedded with rubies # # fall on his head from inside the hat .
After several missed strikes from the blinded Basilisk , it strikes again , right at him this time but Harry plunges the sword into the roof of the Basilisk 's mouth , killing it .
However , one of its poisonous fangs sinks into his arm , injecting a deadly poison .
While Riddle gloats over his `` win '' , Harry takes Riddle 's diary and plunges the Basilisk fang into the diary .
Ink begins pouring out of the book like blood as Riddle 's memory is destroyed .
Ginny immediately stirs and wakes up .
Harry is now moments from death , when Fawkes cries on the wound , and since # # phoenix tears # # have incredible healing properties , Harry is instantly cured .
Harry and Ginny travel back through the Chamber to find # # Ronald Weasley # Ron # # and # # Gilderoy Lockhart # Lockhart # # , who has no idea of who or where he is .
Harry , Ron , Ginny and Lockhart grab onto Fawkes and fly up the tunnel , out of the Chamber -LRB- another phoenix specialty , as they can lift very heavy loads -RRB- .
They return up to the # # Myrtle Warren # Moaning Myrtle # # 's bathroom , where the Entrance seals shut again , and head to McGonagall 's office .

At McGonagall 's office , Harry , Ron , and Ginny find # # Albus Dumbledore # Dumbledore # # , McGonagall , # # Arthur Weasley # Arthur # # and # # Molly Weasley # # , who are delighted to see them alive .
Harry worries that Ginny will get blamed for being the person behind the attacks , but to his great relief Dumbledore rightly deduces that # # Tom Riddle # Voldemort # # is the culprit and only used Ginny 's body .
After Ginny leaves to get a much-needed rest , Harry and Ron both receive two hundred house points each for # # Gryffindor # # and both get an Award for special services to the school , and then Dumbledore asks to speak with Harry alone .
# # Harry Potter # Harry # # expresses his concern that he belonged in # # Slytherin # # .
Dumbledore reveals that # # Tom Riddle # Voldemort # # transferred some of his powers to Harry when he gave him his scar , explaining his ability to speak # # Parseltongue # # .
He asks Harry why he thinks the # # Sorting Hat # # put him in # # Gryffindor # # if he has so many Slytherin qualities , and Harry admits that the only reason it did was because he had asked it to .
Dumbledore confirms this and tells Harry that `` it is our choices , rather than our abilities , that reveal who we truly are '' .
He points out to the sword Harry had drawn out of the hat - Harry now notices it has # # Godric Gryffindor # # 's name on it .
Dumbledore says that only a true Gryffindor would be able to draw it out .

# # Lucius Malfoy # # then barges into McGonagall 's office , outraged that Dumbledore has returned to the school after being dismissed .
Dumbledore calmly responds that # # Hogwarts Board of Governors # the governors # # had asked him to return once they heard that # # Arthur Weasley # # 's daughter was attacked .
Apparently they had been blackmailed by Malfoy to vote for Dumbledore 's dismissal in the first place under Malfoy 's threat of cursing their families .
# # Dobby # # follows Lucius into the room , thus showing that his masters are the # # Malfoy family # Malfoys # # .
Dumbledore and Malfoy have a calm but venomous interchange -LRB- respectively -RRB- , during which Dumbledore and # # Harry Potter # Harry # # -LRB- with the help of # # Dobby # # 's unspoken hints -RRB- essentially expose Lucius sneaking # # Tom Riddle 's Diary # Riddle 's diary # # -LRB- one of his illegal artefacts -RRB- into # # Ginevra Weasley # Ginny # # 's school things during the fight with Arthur at # # Flourish and Blotts # # .
This is supposed to frame Ginny for the attacks , with heavy implications on the # # Muggle Protection Act # # Arthur Weasley has been suggesting .
Malfoy dares Dumbledore to prove his accusation , and while the Headmaster has insufficient evidence to do that , he cautions Malfoy against orchestrating any further such plots , otherwise he is certain that Arthur Weasley would do whatever it took to trace it back to Malfoy .

Knowing that a master can release his # # house-elf # # by giving them some clothes , Harry tricks Malfoy into freeing # # Dobby # # by giving Malfoy one of his own socks , which he promptly throws away to be caught by Dobby .
Malfoy 's retribution is thwarted by the now free Dobby , who then thanks Harry profusely and disappears .
The petrified people are cured , Hagrid is released from Azkaban , Lockhart is sent to a hospital and Lucius Malfoy is fired from his post as school governor .
The book ends with Harry at King 's Cross , crossing the barrier back to the # # Muggle # # world .
