# # Narcissa Malfoy # # and her sister # # Bellatrix Lestrange # # visit # # Severus Snape # # at # # Spinner 's End # # , a poverty-stricken neighbourhood in a northern mill town .
Narcissa wants Snape to help her protect her son # # Draco Malfoy # Draco # # , who has been made a # # Death Eaters # Death Eater # # and has been assigned a mission by # # Tom Riddle # Lord Voldemort # # himself .
Bellatrix advises against this , distrusting Snape for not taking part in the # # Battle of the Department of Mysteries # # at the # # British Ministry of Magic # Ministry of Magic # # , and for his many suspicious actions through the years which make her doubt whether Snape is actually on their side .
Snape explains his behaviour : He was at Hogwarts when Voldemort fell to be a spy for him , he did n't seek him out for the same reason her brother in law and the other deserters did n't look for him , he stopped Voldemort from getting the Philosopher 's Stone because he thought Quirrell wanted it for himself , he never tried to kill Harry Potter because Dumbledore would know about it , and he did n't take part in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries because Voldemort ordered him to stay at Hogwarts .
Snape also tells Narcissa that he knows about Draco 's mission .
Bellatrix tells her sister she should be proud but Narcissa believes that Voldemort is sending him on a suicide mission as punishment for her husband 's failure .
Snape offers to help Draco .
Narcissa asks him to make an Unbreakable Vow and he agrees .
With Bellatrix as their Bonder , Narcissa asks Snape to agree to the following terms :

#That he watch over Draco while he attempts to carry out his mission as a Death Eater .

#That he protect him and make sure he comes to no harm .

#That he do the job for Draco if he proves unable to do it himself .

Snape agrees to all three terms and the vow is made .

# # Albus Dumbledore # # comes to visit # # Harry Potter # # at # # 4 Privet Drive # # to take him to # # The Burrow # # , where he would spend the rest of his summer holidays .
Dumbledore reads # # Sirius Black # # 's will : Harry inherits his deceased godfather 's wealth , the # # House of Black # Black family # # house at # # 12 Grimmauld Place # # , which Harry lets the # # Order of the Phoenix # # continue to use as headquarters , and the # # House-elf # # # # Kreacher # # , whom Harry sends to work at the # # Hogwarts kitchens # # .
Dumbledore then chastises # # Dursley family # the Dursleys # # for their neglect and mistreatment of Harry but asks that he be allowed to return to Privet Drive one final time , and he and Harry depart .

Harry notices Dumbledore has received a serious injury to his right hand , but the Headmaster dismisses it as unimportant .
Dumbledore then asks Harry 's help in convincing an old # # Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry # Hogwarts # # teacher , # # Horace Slughorn # # , to come out of retirement .
They pay him a visit , but Slughorn is reluctant to return to the school , fearing it may put his life in danger from Death Eaters .
Harry tells him that no teachers have died since Dumbledore became Headmaster , except # # Quirinus Quirrell # Professor Quirrell # # , who was working for Voldemort .
This dubious comfort , and the opportunity to get Harry to join his # # Slug Club # # , persuades Slughorn to return to # # Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry # Hogwarts # # .
Dumbledore then drops Harry off at The Burrow , praising him for the way he has handled his godfather 's untimely death and reveals that he would take private classes for him in the forthcoming academic year .

Harry is warmly received at The Burrow by the # # Weasley family # # , who offer him # # Fred and George Weasley # Fred and George 's # # bedroom to sleep in .
Harry meets his best friends # # Ronald Weasley # Ron Weasley # # and # # Hermione Granger # # and Ron 's younger sister # # Ginevra Weasley # Ginny Weasley # # the following morning .
He also meets # # Triwizard Tournament # 1994 Triwizard Tournament # Triwizard Champion # # # # Fleur Delacour # # , who is now working at # # Gringotts Wizarding Bank # Gringotts # # and is engaged to Ron 's oldest brother # # William Weasley # Bill Weasley # # , which is not liked by Hermione , Ginny , and the rest of the Weasleys -LRB- except Ron -RRB- .
Later in the day , the trio receive their # # Ordinary Wizarding Level # O.W.L. # # results ; Harry and Ron receive 7 O.W.L.s while Hermione receives 10 .
However , Harry is slightly disappointed as he has only achieved ' # # Exceeds Expectations # # ' in # # Potions -LRB- class -RRB- # Potions # # , meaning he can no longer realise his ambition as an # # Auror # # as Snape only takes students who have achieved ' # # Outstanding # # ' into his # # Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test # N.E.W.T. # # Potions class .

On the Hogwarts Express , Harry meets his other friends # # Neville Longbottom # # and # # Luna Lovegood # # and shares a compartment with them , as Ron and Hermione are in the # # Prefect # # Carriage .
By now , Harry finds himself attracted to Ginny , although she appears to have long given up on her crush on him and is currently dating Harry 's classmate # # Dean Thomas # # .
Harry and Neville are invited for lunch to Slughorn 's compartment on the train along with Ginny and some other students with connections to well known or influential people .
Before reaching # # Hogsmeade station # # , Harry enters Malfoy 's compartment using his # # Invisibility cloak # # to prove his suspicions about Malfoy .
His suspicions are proved correct : Malfoy tells his friends # # Vincent Crabbe # # , # # Gregory Goyle # # , # # Pansy Parkinson # # and # # Blaise Zabini # # that he has become a Death Eater and he may not return to Hogwarts for his final year if the mission he was assigned by Voldemort is successful .
Unfortunately for Harry , Malfoy notices Harry spying on him and once his friends have alighted from the train , he # # Full Body-Bind Curse # paralyses # # Harry , breaks his nose , covers him with the Invisibility Cloak and leaves him on the train .

Harry and Ron take up # # Charms -LRB- class -RRB- # Charms # # , Defence Against the Dark Arts , # # Herbology # # , Potions and # # Transfiguration # # as their N.E.W.T. subjects .
During the first Defence Against the Arts class of the year , Harry receives a detention from Snape as he had talked back to him following Snape trying to use him as a guinea pig to show how a # # nonverbal spell # # works .
Later that day , they attend Potions , where Harry and Ron receive old copies of '' # # Advanced Potion-Making # Advanced Potion Making # # '' from Slughorn as they did not buy the book .
Harry 's book , previously owned by someone named '' The Half-Blood Prince '' , contains a large number of shortcuts on making various potions , which prove useful in brewing the # # Draught of Living Death # # .
To everyone 's surprise , Harry 's potion is adjudged the best by Slughorn and is awarded a bottle of # # Felix Felicis # # as a prize .
When Harry tells Ron and Hermione about the book , Ginny overhears them and angrily confronts Harry about following the directions of this mysterious book in fear that it may be cursed like # # Tom Riddle 's diary # # .
A jealous Hermione then tries various spells to reveal the true nature of the book , but the book proves to be a normal one , allaying Ginny and Hermione 's fears .

Harry , the new # # Gryffindor Quidditch team # Gryffindor Quidditch # # # # Hogwarts Quidditch Captain # Captain # # , holds trials to select the team for the annual # # Inter-House Quidditch Cup # Quidditch Cup # # .
Due to Harry 's popularity , it proves to be extremely taxing and difficult , with even first-years , # # Ravenclaw # # s and # # Hufflepuff # # s turning up for the trials .
In the end , Harry selects a team which includes among others , seventh-year # # Katie Bell # # , the only member remaining from the Quidditch team Harry joined in his first year , Ginny , who returned as a chaser , and Ron , who returned to his position as # # Keeper # # , staving off competition from another seventh-year and Slug Club member # # Cormac McLaggen # # .
Later Harry , Ron and Hermione go visit Hagrid , who is upset at them as they had dropped his subject , # # Care of Magical Creatures # # .
After lying to Hagrid that they had dropped Care of Magical Creatures as they could not fit it into their timetables , Hagrid reconciles with them .
When the trio return to the # # Great Hall # # for dinner , Harry finds out that Hermione had used the # # Confundus Charm # # on McLaggen so that Ron would become Keeper , but he does not tell Ron this .
Slughorn then invites Harry and Hermione for dinner with the other Slug Club members in his office , which Harry declines as he has to do his detention with Snape .

Harry finds a couple of spells scribbled on the Half-Blood Prince 's textbook .
He tries one of them -LRB- '' # # Levicorpus # # '' -RRB- in his # # Gryffindor Boys ' Dormitory # dormitory # # , but points his wand at Ron by mistake , as a result of which Ron hangs by his ankle from the ceiling .
Later that day , Harry , Ron and Hermione go to # # Hogsmeade # # , where they witness Katie being cursed after touching a strange # # Opal Necklace # necklace # # .
Remembering seeing the same necklace in Borgin 's shop , Harry voices his suspicions of Malfoy to # # Professor # # # # Minerva McGonagall # McGonagall # # , but she , like Ron and Hermione , rubbishes his theory , stating that # # Draco Malfoy # Malfoy # # did not go to Hogsmeade as he had a detention with her , and that there is no proof that he bought the necklace .

In his second lesson with Dumbledore , # # Harry Potter # Harry # # first sees # # Caractacus Burke # # talking about a locket of # # Salazar Slytherin # # 's that a pregnant and desperate # # Merope Riddle # Merope Gaunt # # had sold him , Riddle having abandoned her when she stopped giving him # # Love Potion # # , then goes into a memory of Dumbledore 's to the orphanage that Riddle had grown up in .
# # Harry Potter # Harry # # learns that Merope had later died in childbirth , and that even at an early age , Riddle had developed his powers , which he used to punish people who annoyed him and had a sadistic , cruel and independent nature , just like the adult # # Tom Riddle # Voldemort # # .
Dumbledore also reveals to Harry that Voldemort likes to collect trophies .

During a # # Herbology # # lesson , # # Ronald Weasley # Ron # # expresses his jealousy of not being invited to Slughorn 's upcoming # # Christmas # # party , to the point of teasing # # Hermione Granger # Hermione # # about it .
When she tells him that she was planning to invite him , however , his attitude changes , and they begin to show signs of attraction to each other .
Harry is unsure how he feels about this , remembering his unsuccessful relationship with # # Cho Chang # # during his fifth year .
With Katie unable to play , # # Harry Potter # Harry # # recruits # # Dean Thomas # # onto the # # Quidditch # # team , which continues to improve .
On their way back from practise however , # # Harry Potter # Harry # # and # # Ronald Weasley # Ron # # come across Dean and # # Ginevra Weasley # Ginny # # kissing behind a tapestry .
# # Harry Potter # Harry # # feels a huge surge of jealousy toward Dean , while Ron and Ginny have a heated argument .
# # Ronald Weasley # Ron # # states that he does n't want to see his sister `` snogging '' -LRB- kissing -RRB- people in public , while Ginny tells him that her # # love # # life is none of his business , and that he 's only upset because he 's never kissed anyone , referencing # # Harry Potter # Harry # # and Cho 's relationship and revealing that # # Hermione Granger # Hermione # # had once kissed # # Viktor Krum # # .
This piece of information wrecks Ron 's relationship with # # Hermione Granger # Hermione # # , as well as his # # Quidditch # # skills , and badly alters his personality .
# # Harry Potter # Harry # # meanwhile tries to convince himself that his feelings for # # Ginevra Weasley # Ginny # # are entirely elder brotherly , but eventually realises that he has fallen in love with her.To improve Ron 's Quidditch and mend his friendship with Hermione , Harry pretends to slip Ron some Felix Felicis on the day of the match between Gryffindor and Slytherin .
Feeling lucky , Ron goes on to save everything the Slytherin chasers throw at him , and Gryffindor hammers Slytherin .
However , the plan backfires .
After the match , Ron accuses Hermione of not having faith in his Quidditch abilities , because she thought he really had taken lucky potion , and starts going out with Lavender Brown to spite her .

# Phineas Nigellus about Dumbledore 's mission to Harry . -RCB- -RCB-

On their return to # # Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry # Hogwarts # # , # # Harry Potter # Harry # # notices # # Ginevra Weasley # Ginny # # is not enthusiastic about meeting Dean , and tells # # Hermione Granger # Hermione # # about what he heard between # # Draco Malfoy # Malfoy # # and # # Severus Snape # Snape # # , but she also believes # # Severus Snape # Snape # # was working on # # Albus Dumbledore # Dumbledore # # 's orders .
When # # Harry Potter # Harry # # mentions # # Fenrir Greyback # # , a # # werewolf # # Lupin had told him about during the holidays and the werewolf that bit him , she recalls # # Draco Malfoy # Malfoy # # threatening Borgin with him , and # # Harry Potter # Harry # # states that this proves # # Draco Malfoy # Malfoy # # 's a # # Death Eaters # Death Eater # # .
Hermione , however , got past this one , saying that it might have been `` an empty threat . ''
In his third lesson with # # Albus Dumbledore # Dumbledore # # , # # Harry Potter # Harry # # learns that during his time at # # Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry # Hogwarts # # , # # Tom Riddle # Voldemort # # had gathered a mixture of friends who became the forerunners of the # # Death Eaters # # , and researched his family .
He first investigated his father , and later assumed the name # # Tom Riddle # Lord Voldemort # # upon discovering his father was a # # Muggle # # and never attended Hogwarts .
Dumbledore and Harry then go into # # Morfin Gaunt # # 's memory , where he reveals to his nephew , # # Tom Riddle # Voldemort # # how he was conceived .
After hearing this , Voldemort went on to murder his # # Muggle # # ancestors , taking revenge on them for abandoning him , eliminating the last of the `` unworthy '' Riddle line , stealing Morfin 's father 's ring and implanted false memories into Morfin , framing him for the murders .
In the next memory , Voldemort asks Slughorn about # # Horcrux # # es , which results in Slughorn yelling that he knows nothing about them .
Dumbledore is confident that the memory has been tampered with , however , noting patches of grey fog that came up when Slughorn was shouting , and asks Harry to retrieve the true memory .
Realising Harry is on to him after a botched attempt from Harry to get the memory , Slughorn starts avoiding him , and Harry instead chooses to focus on investigating Malfoy , using the # # Marauder 's Map # # , noticing that Malfoy disappears off it at certain times .

Ron reconciles with Hermione and Ginny .
Some time afterwards , # # Rubeus Hagrid # Hagrid # # tells Harry that he overheard Dumbledore and Snape arguing , and # # Cormac McLaggen # # confronts Harry to ensure he can play in Ron 's place in the upcoming Quidditch match .
Harry also finds out that Ron has been avoiding # # Lavender Brown # Lavender # # .
Later , at the Quidditch match , with Luna commentating , McLaggen grabs a beater 's bat to show the beater how to hit the bludgers , and accidentally cracks Harry 's skull .
Finally , in the hospital wing , Harry summons Kreacher and Dobby and orders them to tail # # Draco Malfoy # Malfoy # # .

In their fourth lesson , Dumbledore is disappointed that Harry failed to obtain Slughorn 's true memory .
Dumbledore shows him two memories : one of Tom Riddle being shown # # Salazar Slytherin 's Locket # # and # # Helga Hufflepuff 's Cup # # by a wealthy woman named # # Hepzibah Smith # # -LRB- he later stole both artefacts -RRB- , the other of Riddle applying for the Defence Against the Dark Arts teaching post at Hogwarts , which Dumbledore rejects as he felt that it was an attempt by Riddle to further search the school for secrets and recruit followers .
This post was thenceforth jinxed by Riddle ; teachers never held the post for more than a year , suffering some terrible fate or humiliation which caused them to leave the position .

The Unknowable Room Picture # # Ron wants to break up with Lavender but does n't know now .
Harry learns from Kreacher and Dobby that Malfoy is regularly visiting the Room of Requirement -LRB- which does n't appear on the Marauder 's Map -RRB- , and spends the next few days trying to get inside .
Not knowing what Malfoy is using it for , he has no success .
Ron and Hermione come back from the Hogsmeade Apparition test , in which Hermione is successful but not Ron , who will take the exam with Harry again .

It turns out that in reality , Slughorn told Riddle everything he wanted to know about Horcruxes , how they were objects that a person can conceal a part of his or her soul in .
This explains how Voldemort was able to survive his rebounding killing curse .
Dumbledore believed that Voldemort made six Horcruxes : his diary -LRB- which Harry destroyed four years earlier -RRB- , the Gaunt 's Ring -LRB- which Dumbledore destroyed the previous year , greatly injuring his hand in the process -RRB- , the locket , the cup , an object pertaining to # # Rowena Ravenclaw # # 's and the snake # # Nagini # # .

Harry learns the next day that Ginny and Dean have split up .
He is unwilling to ask her out though , fearing Ron 's reaction .
Meanwhile , a recovered Katie Bell has returned to the school , and Harry asks who gave her the necklace .
She states that someone Imperiused her in the girl 's bathroom at Rosmerta 's Pub in Hogsmeade .
Shortly before the final Quidditch match of the year , Harry finds Malfoy crying over how his mission is failing .
When he sees Harry , he attacks him .
During the ensuing duel , Harry uses # # Sectumsempra # a spell # # written in The Half Blood Prince 's book , which badly injures Malfoy .
Snape witnesses the event , heals Malfoy , and gives Harry a large number of detentions that cause him to miss the match .
Upon returning to the Gryffindor common room after his first detention , he discovers that the team had won the Quidditch Cup in his absence , and Ginny runs up and hugs him .
At this point , Harry finally reveals his feelings for Ginny and kisses her .
Both of them are ecstatic and start dating .

Some time later , Dumbledore asks Harry to come to his office .
On the way , he runs into his old # # Divination # # teacher # # Sybill Trelawney # Professor Trelawney # # , who was trying to hide sherry bottles in the Room of Requirement before being thrown out .
She tells Harry that she heard a male voice -LRB- which Harry suspects to be Malfoy 's -RRB- whooping before she was ejected , and also reveals that Snape had told Voldemort about the prophecy concerning him and Harry , which caused him to murder Harry 's parents .
Harry expresses outrage that Dumbledore later gave Snape a job at Hogwarts , but Dumbledore states that Snape felt great remorse for what he had done .
He then asks Harry to join him in finding a Horcrux , Slytherin 's locket , which Harry agrees to .
Before leaving , Harry tells Ron and Hermione that Malfoy 's almost certainly going to try something tonight , and gives them the remainder of the # # Felix Felicis # # .

Dumbledore and Harry travel to a cave in which Voldemort had tormented two children in his youth .
They proceed through the cave , coming to an island in the middle of a lake .
On the island , they find a basin of # # Emerald Potion # emerald green potion # # , with the locket at the bottom .
On Dumbledore 's orders , Harry reluctantly force-feeds him the potion , which badly weakens him and causes extreme thirst .
In an attempt to save him , Harry gives him # # water # # from the lake , awakening dozens of # # Inferius # Inferi # # Voldemort had placed to guard his Horcrux .
Harry attempts to fight , but there are too many of them .
Just as he is about to be overwhelmed , Dumbledore creates a ring of fire around them , which fends off the Inferi , and allows them to escape with the locket to Hogsmeade , where they discover the # # Dark Mark # # above the astronomy tower at Hogwarts .

Borrowing broomsticks , the pair fly to the tower .
Upon hearing someone approaching them , Dumbledore uses a charm to paralyse Harry and hides him under his invisibility cloak , before being disarmed by Malfoy .
Malfoy reveals that he had let Death Eaters into the school through a pair of vanishing cabinets , which were the objects Harry had overheard him questioning Borgin about .
Malfoy also explains that he was behind the cursed necklace and poisoned mead incidents , which were really assassination attempts on Dumbledore .
Dumbledore reveals that he had known Malfoy was attempting to kill him , but allowed him to remain at Hogwarts because he knew that Voldemort would have murdered Malfoy once his cover had been blown .
Dumbledore tries to persuade him to change sides , but the other Death Eaters join the scene and urge Malfoy to finish his mission .
Then Snape appears , and with Malfoy still reluctant to finish off the unarmed Dumbledore , Snape kills Dumbledore .

Released from the spell after Dumbledore 's death , Harry pursues Snape through battle in the halls of the school and out onto the grounds .
Near the entrance to Hogwarts , Harry attempts to curse Snape , who repels his attacks with ease and reminds the other Death Eaters they are not to harm the boy .
When Harry tries one of the Half-Blood Prince 's spells , an enraged Snape reveals that the spell is his own .
He is the Half-Blood Prince , having taken the title when he was a student as a pun on his mother 's maiden name .
-LRB- Hermione 's research later reveals that Snape 's father was a Muggle named # # Tobias Snape # # and his mother a pureblood witch named # # Eileen Prince # # . -RRB-
# # Buckbeak # # the # # Hippogriff # # attacks Snape , who leaves Harry behind and escapes with Draco Malfoy .
When he returns to Dumbledore 's body , Harry finds that # # Regulus Black 's locket # the locket was a fake # # : the real horcrux was already stolen by # # Regulus Black # someone with the initials R.A.B. # #

After the battle , Ginny accompanies Harry to the hospital wing , where he learns that the only other person who died was a Death Eater .
None of Harry 's friends are badly hurt , apart from # # William Weasley # Bill Weasley # # , the Weasleys ' oldest child who was attacked by an untransformed Greyback , although the only side effects are permanent scars across his face and a liking for rare steaks .
# # Fleur Delacour # Fleur # # expresses her desire to marry Bill despite his potential transformations , and she and Mrs Weasley reconcile .
# # Nymphadora Tonks # Tonks # # reveals her love for # # Remus Lupin # Lupin # # , who had refused her because he was a werewolf and felt that she deserved someone young and whole , unlike himself .
Professor McGonagall questions Harry about what he and Dumbledore were doing , but Harry , under orders from Dumbledore not to tell anyone except Ron and Hermione , refuses .
The teachers then discuss the future of Hogwarts , and plans for Dumbledore 's funeral .
Harry turns his back on the Half-Blood Prince 's book , and regrets ever possessing it , although Hermione and Ron comfort him , stating that while the Prince may have had a mean sense of humour , nothing in the book ever indicated that he was evil , or capable of murder .

-LCB- -LCB- dialogue a-b # Rufus Scrimgeour # I see you are -- # Harry Potter # Dumbledore 's man through and through .
That 's right .
# Harry to Scrimgeour . -RCB- -RCB-

The funeral is attended by many witches and wizards , including a number of minor characters in the series .
During the funeral , Harry ends his relationship with Ginny to protect her from Voldemort .
She reveals that she had never given up on him ; Hermione had advised her to go out with other people so she could relax around Harry , as previously she had trouble talking to him .
As a result , he fell in love with her upon seeing who she really was , and regrets not asking her out sooner .
Harry then meets Scrimgeour , who again makes the offer he 'd made to Harry at Christmas , which Harry again turns down .
He then tells Ron and Hermione of his intention to leave Hogwarts to destroy the Horcruxes and then Voldemort himself .
His two best friends agree to travel with him on his quest , and Harry happily acknowledges that there is `` still one last golden day of peace left to enjoy with Ron and Hermione '' .
